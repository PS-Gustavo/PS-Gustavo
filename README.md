Hi, welcome to my Github page.

I'm currently working on automotive software development (at the application level) using C/C++ under the AUTOSAR and Misra C methodologies. I also extensively use MATLAB and Embedded Tools;

I have a pet project named [Skelly](https://github.com/PS-Gustavo/RESkelly), which aims to provide a quick and simple rendering environment for graphical applications. It uses C++ and CMake for packaging.

My current goal is to start more actively contributing towards FOSS projects and learn more towards Kernel or Compiler engineering.

Please feel free to reach me at my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grlopes/) page or my [e-mail](mailto:gustavo@punti.com.br).
