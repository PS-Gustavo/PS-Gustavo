Hi, welcome to my page.

My primary role is working on automotive software development (at the application level) using AUTOSAR and Embedded Tools;

I am also learning rendering techniques and developing a modular graphics engine as a hobby by using C++ and CMake;

Please feel free to reach me at my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grlopes/) page or my [e-mail](mailto:gustavo@punti.com.br).
