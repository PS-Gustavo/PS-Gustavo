Hi, welcome to my Github page.

I currently work as a consultant to companies on the Adtech space. I work on core functionalities, bidding and serving ads by using C++ and Python accross different services.

I am returning to my pet project after a break, [Skelly](https://github.com/PS-Gustavo/RESkelly), which aims to provide a barebones environment for graphical applications.

Feel free to reach me at my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grlopes/) profile or my [e-mail](mailto:gustavo@punti.com.br).
